## CBRAIN Release Notes

#### Version 4.0.0 Released 2015-03-27

This is the first publicly released version of the CBRAIN platform.
There are still significant rough edges in the code and the
installation procedure, and the Wiki documentation is about 80%
complete.

In the near future, we plan to:

- Move our code issues from our internal Redmine server to GitHub's issue tracker.
- Implement significant performance improvements that have revealed themselves necessary in production.
- Finish the documentation.

Currently available plugins packages are:

- [cbrain-plugins-mni](https://github.com/aces/cbrain-plugins-mni)
- [cbrain-plugins-fsl](https://github.com/aces/cbrain-plugins-fsl)
