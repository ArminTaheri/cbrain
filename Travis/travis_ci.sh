# This script is used by Travis CI (https://travis-ci.org/) to run the        #
# CBRAIN test suite.                                                          #
#                                                                             #
# The script expects a testing docker container to already have been built    #
# and made available from the local system. The name of that docker image is  #
# expected in the environement variable $CBRAIN_CI_IMAGE_NAME, or given as a  #
# first argument to the script.                                               #
#                                                                             #
# This script does the following:                                             #
#   - Invoke the container as part of a docker-compose setup, which           #
#     links the image to a MariaDB service.                                   #
#   - Run the testing suite inside the container.                             #
#   - Returns the return code (and possibly diagnostics) of the suite.        #
#                                                                             #
