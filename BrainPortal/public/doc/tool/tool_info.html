<h1>Viewing Tool Accessibility</h1>

<p>The tools information page (see figure below) displays information about all the available tools, the user that owns them, the group they belong to, the execution server on which they are installed and the type of tool (conversion or scientific) that they are.  You must belong to a group that the tool is assigned to and the execution server that it is installed on must be available in order to use the tool.</p>
