<h1>How to Register Files on CBRAIN</h1>
<p>A Data Provider is a data storage center that CBRAIN is aware of.  A user has access to MainStore and MindStore data providers as well as an "incoming data provider". The "incoming data provider" is a provider set up by the network administrator that could be under another name.  Please contact your network administrator for additional details.</p>
<p>    
Data files can be uploaded to CBRAIN using SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol). You may connect using any SFTP client for UNIX, Mac or Windows on host mindstorm.cbrain.mcgill.ca using the port number 7500.  Your username and password are those of the CBRAIN website.
