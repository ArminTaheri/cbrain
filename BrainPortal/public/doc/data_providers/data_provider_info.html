<h1>How to Register Files on CBRAIN</h1>

A Data Provider is a data storage area that CBRAIN is aware of.
A typical user has access to two data providers named MainStore and
MindStore as well as two "incoming data providers". An "incoming
data provider" is a provider set up by the network administrator
that can be accessed through another protocol outside of the CBRAIN
framework. The two "incoming data providers" currently set up are
named "SFTP-Incoming" and "SFTP-Brainstorm", and are accessed using SFTP
(Secure File Transfer Protocol).

<p>
Data files can be uploaded to CBRAIN using SFTP client programs on your computer.
You may connect using any SFTP client for UNIX, Mac or
Windows on host mindstorm.cbrain.mcgill.ca or brainstorm.cbrain.mcgill.ca
using the port number 7500. Your username and password are those
of the CBRAIN website. Files uploaded to <em>mindstorm</em> will appear in CBRAIN with
the "browse" button of the "SFTP-Incoming" Data Provider, while files
uploaded to <em>brainstorm</em> will appear in the "SFTP-Brainstorm" Data Provider.
