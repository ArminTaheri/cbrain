<h1>Registering Files on CBRAIN</h1>

<p>A Data Provider is a data storage center that CBRAIN is aware of.  A user has access to MainStore, MindStore and Incoming data providers.  Data files can also be uploaded to CBRAIN using SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol).  You may connect using any SFTP client for UNIX, Mac or Windows on host mindstorm.cbrain.mcgill.ca using the port number 7500.  Your username and password are those of the CBRAIN website.
