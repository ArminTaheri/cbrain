<h1>Groups and Projects</h1>

Groups facilitate the sharing of files between users.  There are four types of groups: system groups, site groups, user groups and work groups.

<b>Creating a Project</b>
<br>
By selecting the <b>Create Project</b> drop down menu, you can create a new project.  The resulting project is a Work Group that only the creator of the group can access.  Only a site manager or administrator can assign an additional site and users to these work groups.
