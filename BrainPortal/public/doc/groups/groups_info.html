<h1>Understanding Projects</h1>
By selecting the <b>Create Project</b> drop down menu under the <b>Projects</b> tab, you can create a new project.  The resulting project is a Work Project that only the creator of the project can access.

Projects facilitate the sharing of files and resources between users.  When an <b>Active Project</b> is selected, files and resources associated with that particular project become available under the various tabs.
