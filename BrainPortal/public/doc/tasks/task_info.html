<h1>How to Control Tasks</h1>

The <b>Tasks</b> tab allow a user to have a certain amount of control over the execution of tasks, which are listed below.  Tasks are assigned different stages as they proceed through processing.  Those stages include "Setup", "Queued", "Cluster", "Post Processing" and "Completed" stages.  The <b>Setup</b> stage sets up the files to be processed. When a task is <b>Queued</b> it is waiting to be processed.  The <b>Cluster</b> (also referred to as the running stage) stage is the scientific processing stage. The <b>Post Processing</b> stage saves the results back to the CBRAIN data provider.  The <b>Completed</b> stage indicates that the processing has been completed.  Should a task fail, failure recovery code can be triggered.

<ul>
<li><b>Operations for Queued Tasks</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Hold queued tasks</li>
        <li>Release held tasks</li>
    </ul>
<li><b>Operations for Running Tasks</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Suspend running task</li>
        <li>Resume suspended tasks</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Operations for failed tasks</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Trigger failure recovery code</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li><b>Operations for completed tasks</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Restart tasks at "Setup" stage</li>
        <li>Restart tasks at "Cluster" stage</li>
        <li>Restart tasks at "Post Processing" stage</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li><b>Operations for All Tasks</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Duplicate selected tasks and start them anew</li>
        <li>Terminate selected tasks</li>
        <li>Remove selected tasks</li>
