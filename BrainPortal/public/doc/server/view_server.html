<h1>Viewing Server Information</h1>
<br>
<br>
The <b>Servers</b> tab links to a page (see below) that gives you the ability to see the details of the available execution servers.  Servers can be assigned a site, group, you can define whether or not they are online or offline and alive or not.  Workers process jobs on the cluster and the load refers to the jobs currently being executed on the cluster.
