<h1>Introduction To Access Profiles</h1>

Access Profiles are way to simplify user access management to sets of projects.
<p>
An Access Profile is basically a set of arbitrary projects. When users are created<br>
or modified, they can be assigned to one (or several) Access Profiles, and thus<br>
they become a member of all their projects immediately.
<p>
Access Profiles and all their properties are never visible to normal users.

<h2>Creating an Access Profile</h2>

When creating a new Access Profile, the admin can set a color to help<br>
differentiate it from other Access Profiles. Projects can also immediately<br>
be assigned to it.

<h2>Deleting an Access Profile</h2>
Removing an Access Profile from a user will remove all the projects at once<br>
(except those that may be part of other Access Profiles).

<h2>Adjusting an Access Profile: adjusting the projects</h2>
Adjusting the set of project in an Access Profile will (by default) immediately<br>
affect all users associated with that Access Profile; however the<br>
admin can select which users will be affected by the change using the checkboxes<br>
at the bottom of the project list.

<h2>Adjusting an Access Profile: adjusting the users</h2>
Adjusting the list of users associated with an Access Profile will affect<br>
all those users: they will either become members of all the projects in<br>
the profile (if the user is added) or might lose access to the project<br>
(if removed, and the project is in no other access profile that the<br>
user has access to).
