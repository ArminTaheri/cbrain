    # From the 'squeue' man page:
    # BF  BOOT_FAIL       Job terminated due to launch failure, typically due to a hardware failure (e.g. unable to boot the node or block and the job can not be requeued).
    # CA  CANCELLED       Job was explicitly cancelled by the user or system administrator.  The job may or may not have been initiated.
    # CD  COMPLETED       Job has terminated all processes on all nodes with an exit code of zero.
    # CF  CONFIGURING     Job has been allocated resources, but are waiting for them to become ready for use (e.g. booting).
    # CG  COMPLETING      Job is in the process of completing. Some processes on some nodes may still be active.
    # F   FAILED          Job terminated with non-zero exit code or other failure condition.
    # NF  NODE_FAIL       Job terminated due to failure of one or more allocated nodes.
    # PD  PENDING         Job is awaiting resource allocation.
    # PR  PREEMPTED       Job terminated due to preemption.
    # R   RUNNING         Job currently has an allocation.
    # SE  SPECIAL_EXIT    The job was requeued in a special state. This state can be set by users, typically in EpilogSlurmctld, if the job has terminated with a particular exit value.
    # ST  STOPPED         Job has an allocation, but execution has been stopped with SIGSTOP signal.  CPUS have been retained by this job.
    # S   SUSPENDED       Job has an allocation, but execution has been suspended and CPUs have been released for other jobs.
    # TO  TIMEOUT         Job terminated upon reaching its time limit.
