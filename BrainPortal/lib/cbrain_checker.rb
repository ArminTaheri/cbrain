# Checker class implementing the runtime and sanity check framework.
#
# Original author: Nicolas Kassis
#
# $Id$

# This class implements 2 core methods to the runtime and database check system
# The check command is used to run all methods of a class (defined in subclasses) 
# which start with ensure_, check_ or start_. In addion, these methods can be 
# prioritized by adding a number after the ensure_/check_/start_ in the method name
# Example method defined in subclass
#    
#  def self.ensure_the_truth_is_true
#    if true
#      #-------------------------------------------
#      puts "C> Truth has been confirmed to be true
#      #-------------------------------------------
#    end
#  end
#
# There is also a self.all method which returns a sorted list of all the tests as an array.
