Description:
    Stubs out a model and (optionally) a view for a new cluster 
    task. Pass the task name as the first argument.
    
    The view created is a form where the user may input arguments 
    for tasks that require them.
    
Examples:
    ./script/generate cluster_task civet
    
    The following files will be generated:
    app/models/drmaa_civet.rb
    app/views/tasks/_drmaa_civet.html.erb


    ./script/generate cluster_task mincinfo --no-view
    
    The following file will be generated:
    app/models/drmaa_mincinfo.rb
