# = SSH Tunnel Utility Class 
#
# This class provides the functionality necessary to create,
# destroy, and manage persistent SSH tunnels to other hosts.
# Tunnels are tied to a master, persistent SSH process running in
# a subprocess; the master SSH process is controled using the
# instance methods of this class, where each instance represent
# one of these master SSH process. There can only be at most
# one master SSH process per combination of remote host,
# remote user and remote port, and this class ensures this
# by registering internally all instance objects created
# during new().
#
# Assuming SSH keys have been exchanged already, a ruby program
# can setup and manage a tunnel this way. Let's say the remote
# host 'my.example.com' is behind a firewall and runs a HTTP server
# on port 8080 that we would like to access, even though this port
# is not visible from here.
#
#    master = SshTunnel.new('john','my.example.com',22)
#    master.add_tunnel(:forward,1234,'localhost',8080)
#    master.start
#    # Now we can connect to port 1234 locally and see the web server.
#    # Later on, even if we have lost the variable 'master'
#    # above, we can find it again to kill the tunnel:
#    master = SshTunnel.find('john','my.example.com',22)
#    master.stop
#
# The master SSH process uses connection sharing to improve
# connection latency; this is accomplished by allocating UNIX
# domain sockets in /tmp; see also the ControlMaster and
# ControlPath options in SSH's manual (in particular, for
# the man page ssh_config, and for the '-o' option of 'ssh').
