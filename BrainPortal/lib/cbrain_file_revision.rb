# This class encapsulates an information record about
# the revision control history of a file. It was created
# as a transition mechanism between SVN and GIT. In SVN
# all classes used to define a constant called Revision_info
# whose value would be initialized by the programmer to the
# string'$Id$' but would be substituted, by SVN, for a
# longer description of the file's name, commit ID,
# commit author and date. As a replacement, we now
# require programmers to add this at the beginning of
# their classes:
#
#   Revision_info=CbrainFileRevision[__FILE__]
#
# This initalize the constant to a handler object of
# class CbrainFileRevision which records the file path
# in one of its internal attribute. Later one, if
# a piece of code wants to extract from it its revision
# ID (or author name etc) then a 'git' command will be
# issued to extract the info, and it will be cached in
# the object. The process is 'lazy' in that the git
# command is only executed the first time a to_s() is
# invoked.
#
# Objects of this class, otherwise, belong much like
# strings, but sometimes you might want to call to_s()
# or self_update() explicitely.
#
# Examples:
#
#   # At the top of a class:
#   class Abcd
#     Revision_info=CbrainFileRevision[__FILE__]
#   end
#
#   # Then later on, all these calls are similar:
#   puts Abcd::Revision_info.to_s # in SVN-like format
#   puts Abcd::Revision_info.svn_id_rev # using CBRAIN's svn_id_rev parser
#   puts Abcd.revision_info.svn_id_rev  # using CBRAIN's revision_info method
#   x = Abcd.new
#   puts x.revision_info.svn_id_rev
#   puts x.revision_info.short_commit # using attributes
#
#   # If at least once to_s() or self_update() has been called,
#   # the the attributes can also be accessed directly:
#   Abcd::Revision_info.self_update
#   puts Abcd::Revision_info.author  # faster than svn_id_author()
#
