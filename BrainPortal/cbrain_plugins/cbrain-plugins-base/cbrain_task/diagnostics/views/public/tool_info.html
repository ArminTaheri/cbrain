<h1>Diagnostics</h1>

This task is provided with the basic CBRAIN platform. It serves several
purposes:

<ul>
  <li>It can be used to verify the configuration of a Bourreau server, including
      testing the full cycle of setting up a job, launching it, and post processing it;</li>
  <li>It can be used by system programmers to try (and validate) the special
      form input fields helpers that CBRAIN provides for writing CbrainTasks;</li>
  <li>It can ask the Bourreau side to perform some connectivity tests with the Data Providers;</li>
  <li>It can be used by system programmers to trigger some task lifecycle events on the Portal side
      during task creation and edit, in order to test the Rails tasks_controller.</li>
</ul>

Normally, in a production environment, this task is not to be made
available to normal users, but only to administrators.
