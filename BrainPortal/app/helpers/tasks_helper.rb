  # to the partial suitable for Rails:

  #   task_partial(:my_stuff) or task_partial('my_stuff')
  #
  # will return
  #
  #   "tasks/cbrain_plugins/cbrain_task/{taskname}/views/my_stuff.html.erb"
  #
  # which will work through the symlink at the 'cbrain_plugins' level.
  # Note that the real file must start with a '_', like all partials.
  #
  # This is useful for developers of tasks that are 'plugins', they
  # don't have to know exatcly where their partial will end up on the
  # filesystem and can just use the plain name of their file in their own
  # task's 'views'.
