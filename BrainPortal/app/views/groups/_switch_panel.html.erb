        <p>
          Choosing an Active Project affects the visibility of <strong>files</strong><br/>
          and <strong>tasks</strong> the interface.<br/>
        <p>
          It's a bit like having a permanent filter on the <em>Project</em> column<br/>
          (which will actually disappear when you choose your active project).<br/>
          Use this as a way to concentrate on a particular project.
