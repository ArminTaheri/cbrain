(emacs:16022): GLib-WARNING **: In call to g_spawn_sync(), exit status of a child process was requested but ECHILD was received by waitpid(). Most likely the process is ignoring SIGCHLD, or some other thread is invoking waitpid() with a nonpositive first argument; either behavior can break applications that use g_spawn_sync either directly or indirectly.
