  <p class="medium_paragraphs">
  This panel allows you to <strong>unregister</strong> files that are present on
  the remote Data Provider and have already been registered by
  the CBRAIN interface. Once unregistered, a file will be no longer
  be visible in the <strong>Files</strong> manager, but will still be left
  on the disk at the remote site. It will be your responsability
  to delete the data manually if you have an external access
  to the remote files, or you can use the <strong>Delete Files</strong>
  panel, further right.
