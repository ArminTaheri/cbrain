<% acc.section "How to View Files" do %>
The <b>Files</b> tab, called the file manager, is a link to an interface that displays a list of files, file details and a file management menu bar at the top of the page.  The file management menu bar consists of nine tabs.  More details can be displayed for each file by selecting the <b>Show Details</b> button. Jiv Files are shown as links under files as children resulting from a minc2jiv operation.  Additionally, files highlighted in pink are unavailable.  Each individual file has a details page that can be accessed by clicking on that particular file.
<br><br>
Each execution server has a cache or storage area set aside for files that have been transferred and executed on that execution server. Files are permanently stored on <b>Data Providers</b>.  The synchronization symbols, which list the status of a file, are displayed beside the file.  These symbols indicate where copies of the files are stored on available clusters.  This is useful, allowing a user to navigate to the <b>Data Providers</b> tab click on the <b>Click here to view disk usage statistics</b> link, select a cache and clean up the cache.  This action deletes any files being stored on the selected cache ensuring the privacy of the files.  Additionally, these symbols can be useful by indicating where files are already stored, allowing a user to execute other tasks on them using the same execution server.  This speeds up execution time and prevents copies of files from being transferred and stored on other execution servers needlessly.  Placing your mouse pointer over the symbol displays more information about the execution server and other file details.  A legend of the symbols are shown at the bottom of the files page and include:

<ul>
<li><b>ProvNewer</b>
<ul>
    <li>Indicates that no known files on cache side or files on data provider side are known to be newer (default when there are no SyncStatus object at all).</li>
</ul>

<li><b>CacheNewer</b>
<ul>
    <li>Indicates that the file on cache side is known to be newer than on data provider.</li>
</ul>
</li>   
<li><b>InSync</b><br>
<ul>
    <li>Indicates that the file contains a synched version of the data provider's content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>ToCache</b><br>
<ul>
    <li>Indicates that the data provider's file is being copied to cache.</li>
</ul>    
</li>
<li><b>ToProvider</b><br>
<ul>
    <li>Indicates that the cached file is being copied to data provider.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Corrupted</b><br>
<ul>
    <li>Indicates that a transfer to a provider was never completed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<ul>
<li><b>System Projects</b></li>
<ul>
    <li>Every user on CBRAIN is automatically a member of the system project everyone.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Site Project</b></li>
<ul>
    <li>Each site has a site project automatically associated with it.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>User Projects</b></li>    
<ul>
    <li>Every user on CBRAIN is automatically assigned a project, that only they are a member of, specified by that user's username.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Work Projects</b></li>
<ul>
    <li>A work project is a type of project that can be created by anyone.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

File permissions are managed through projects.  Project files are files that can be shared between members of a project.  Users can be members of any project that either the site manager or the CBRAIN administrator has assigned to them or that they created themselves. A file can only belong to one project but a user can belong to many projects.  You can setproject permissions by selecting the file, <b>Update Files Attributes</b>, the project and the permissions.

<br>
<% end %>

<% acc.section "How to Move and Copy Files" do %>
Click on the <b>Files</b> tab.  You can move or copy files from one data provider to another by selecting the files and by using the <b>Move/Copy Files</b> button on the files menu.<br>
<% end %>

<% acc.section "How to Use and Access Tools" do %>

Click on the <b>Files</b> tab.  The <b>Conversion Tool</b> and <b>Scientific Tool</b> drop downs on the file management menu provide a drop down selection of conversion and scientific tools respectively that can be applied to files as tasks. When a tool is selected from the drop down menu, another select box appears to specify an execution server to complete the task.  Execution servers that have that particular tool available and that you have sufficient privileges to access, will be presented as possible selections along with an option to select a cluster to execute the task randomly.  For some tools, you must select files and the desired tool to be brought to an option selection page.  An example tool option selection page is shown below.
<br>
<br>
<img src="/doc/userfiles/civet_tool_options.png"><br>

<p>Once a task has completed, the resulting files are placed in the files list on the <b>Files</b> tab page.  For example, once a Civet task has been run using the <b>Civet Tool</b> a <b>Civet Collection</b> is returned.  Clicking on that particular resulting Civet Collection from a Civet task brings you to the file details page (see below).  Through this page you can see the details of the Civet Collection and there is a link to edit the file.  The <b>Contents</b> link displays the Civet output image files.
