# Model representing a job request made to an remote execution server (Bourreau) on a cluster.
# Typically this class is not used directly, instead intermediate subclasses are
# used on the Portal side and on the Bourreau side:
#
#   PortalTask  < CbrainTask
#   ClusterTask < CbrainTask
#
class CbrainTask < ActiveRecord::Base

  # The attribute 'params' is a serialized hash table
  # containing job-specific parameters; it's up to each
  # subclass of CbrainTask to find/use/define its content
  # as necessary.
  serialize :params

  # The attribute 'prerequisites' is a serialized hash table
  # containing the information about whether the current
  # task depend on the states of other tasks. As an example,
  # if the hash is this:
  #
  #     {
  #        :for_setup           => { "T12" => "Queued", "T13" => "Completed" },
  #        :for_post_processing => { "T66" => "Failed" },
  #     }
  #
  # then the task will be setup by a Worker only when task #12 and #13 are
  # in the indicated states or further, and the task will enter post_process() only
  # when task #66 has failed. The only allowed keys right now are
  # :for_setup and :for_post_processing, as these are the only two
  # states triggered by Workers.
  #
  # The task's ID are serialized with strings with a prefix consisting
  # of the single character 'T'. This is needed so that the structure
  # is properly serialized in XML during ActiveResource transport.
  #
  # The only allowed state values for the conditions are:
  #
  #  - 'Queued' (which also covers ALL subsequent states up to 'Completed')
  #  - 'Data Ready' (which also covers 'Completed')
  #  - 'Completed'
  #  - 'Failed' (which covers all failures)
  #
  # As an aide, note that in a way, a task ID 'n' in the CbrainTask attribute
  # :share_wd_tid also implies this prerequisite:
  #
  #     :for_setup => { "T#{n}" => "Queued" }
  #
  # unless a more restrictive prerequisite is already supplied for task 'n'.

  # Utility Methods
  ##################################################################

  # Returns a simple name for the task (without the Cbrain prefix stuff).
  # Example: from 'CbrainTask::Civet' we get 'Civet'
  def name
    @name ||= self.class.to_s.sub(/^CbrainTask::/,"")

  # Returns a longer name for the task (without the Cbrain prefix stuff)
  # that includes the task's Bourreau name and ID.
  # Example: 'Civet@MyBourreau/23'
  def fullname
    mybourreau = self.bourreau.name rescue "(Unknown)"

  # Useful ID Generators
  ##################################################################

  # Returns an ID string containing both the bourreau_id +bid+
  # and the task ID +tid+ in format "bid/tid". Example:
  #     "3/4"   # Bourreau #3, task #4
  def bid_tid

  # Returns an ID string containing both the bourreau_name +bname+
  # and the task ID +tid+ in format "bname/tid". Example:
  #     "Mammouth/4"   # Bourreau 'Mammouth', task #4
  def bname_tid
    @bname_tid ||= "#{self.bourreau.name || '?'}/#{self.id || '?'}"
  end

  # Returns an ID string containing both the bourreau_name +bname+
  # and the task ID +tid+ in format "bname-tid" ; this is suitable to
  # be used as part of a filename. Example:
  #     "Mammouth-4"   # Bourreau 'Mammouth', task #4
  def bname_tid_dashed
    @bname_tid_dashed ||= "#{self.bourreau.name || 'Unk'}-#{self.id || 'Unk'}"
  end



  ##################################################################
  # Run Number ID Methods
  ##################################################################

  # Returns the 'run_number' of a task; this allows running the same
  # task multiple times in the same work directory. The run number
  # is increased after each succesful 'restart' operation, but it
  # stays the same in error recovery modes.
