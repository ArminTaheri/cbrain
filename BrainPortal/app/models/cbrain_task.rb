# Model representing a job request made to an remote execution server (Bourreau) on a cluster.
# Typically this class is not used directly, instead intermediate subclasses are
# used on the Portal side and on the Bourreau side:
#
#   PortalTask  < CbrainTask
#   ClusterTask < CbrainTask
#
class CbrainTask < ActiveRecord::Base

  # The attribute 'prerequisites' is a serialized hash table
  # containing the information about whether the current
  # task depend on the states of other tasks. As an example,
  # if the hash is this:
  #
  #     {
  #        :for_setup           => { "T12" => "Queued", "T13" => "Completed" },
  #        :for_post_processing => { "T66" => "Failed" },
  #     }
  #
  # then the task will be setup by a Worker only when task #12 and #13 are
  # in the indicated states or further, and the task will enter post_process() only
  # when task #66 has failed. The only allowed keys right now are
  # :for_setup and :for_post_processing, as these are the only two
  # states triggered by Workers.
  #
  # The task's ID are serialized with strings with a prefix consisting
  # of the single character 'T'. This is needed so that the structure
  # is properly serialized in XML during ActiveResource transport.
  #
  # The only allowed state values for the conditions are:
  #
  #  - 'Queued' (which also covers ALL subsequent states up to 'Completed')
  #  - 'Data Ready' (which also covers 'Completed')
  #  - 'Completed'
  #  - 'Failed' (which covers all failures)
  #
  # As an aide, note that in a way, a task ID 'n' in the CbrainTask attribute
  # :share_wd_tid also implies this prerequisite:
  #
  #     :for_setup => { "T#{n}" => "Queued" }
  #
  # unless a more restrictive prerequisite is already supplied for task 'n'.
