# This this is an abstract class which represents data providers
# where the remote files are not even remote, they are local
# to the currently running rails application. 
#
# Subclasses are not meant to cache anything! The 'remote' files
# are in fact all local, and accessing the 'cached' files means
# accessing the real provider's files. All methods are adjusted
# so that their behavior is sensible.
#
# Not all API methods are defined here so this class is not meant
# to be instantiated directly.
#
# For the list of API methods, see the DataProvider superclass.
