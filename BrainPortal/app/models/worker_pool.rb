# = WorkerPool
#
# This class is reponsible for providing worker pool management commands:
# [create_or_find_pool] Creates a pool of workers if it cannot find ones already running. Created workers are automatically started.
# [wake_up_workers]     Wakes up all workers in the pool.
# [stop_workers]        Terminates all workers in the pool.
#
# == Usage:
#
#  bourreau_workers = WorkerPool.create_or_find_pool(MyWorkerClass, 5, { :name => "Abc" } )
#  bourreau_workers.wake_up_workers # if needed
#  bourreau_workers.stop
#
# WARNING: Current limitation is that only 1 pool is allowed per Worker subclass.
