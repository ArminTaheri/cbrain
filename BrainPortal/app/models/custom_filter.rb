# Custom filter model

#This model represents a user defined filter. The class is not meant
#to be used directly, but instead to be subclassed for the particular
#resource to be filtered. The most critical aspect in the subclass 
#is it's redifinition of the method filter_scope.
#
#=*IMPORTANT*: Naming conventions
#[*Controller*] The name of the subclass should be the camelcased name of
#               of the filtered resource as it appears in its controller. E.g.
#               UserfileCustomFilter filters on the UserfilesController,
#               TaskCustomFilter filters on the TasksController. Alternatively,
#               the method filtered_class_controller can be redifined to return the
#               the name of the controller being filtered on.
#[<b>Partial for new and edit actions</b>] This should saved in app/view/custom_filter/ and
#                                          should match the underscored version of the class
#                                          name. E.g. _userfile_custom_filter.html.erb for
#                                          UserfileCustomFilter.
#[<b>Type parameter</b>] A type paramter will be sent to the new and create actions of the
#                        CustomFilterController. This parameter should match the part of 
#                        of the class name excluding "CustomFilter". E.g. for UserfileCustomFilter,
#                        the type parameter should be "userfile".
#
#=Attributes:
#[*name*] A string representing the name of the filter.
#[*data*] A hash containing the filter parameters.
#= Associations:
#*Belongs* *to*:
#* User
