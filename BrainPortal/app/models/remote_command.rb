# Remote Command class; NOT AN ACTIVE RECORD!

# This model encapsulates a record with a precise list
# of attributes. This is not an ActiveRecord, it's a
# subclass of Hash. See RestrictedHash for more info.
# Note that the attributes are used for an ActiveResource
# request, and therefore must be filled with strings.
#
# The attributes in this particular model are used to
# encode the kind of commands that a RemoteResource can
# send to another RemoteResource, using the Controls
# controller and the Control ActiveResource, which
# are used by all CBRAIN Rails applications.
