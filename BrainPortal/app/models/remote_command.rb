# Remote Command class; NOT AN ACTIVE RECORD!

# Original author: Pierre Rioux

# $Id$
#

# This model encapsulates a record with a precise list
# of attributes. This is not an ActiveRecord, it's a
# subclass of Hash. See RestrictedHash for more info.
# Note that the attributes are used for an ActiveResource
# request, and therefore must be filled with strings.
#
# The attributes in this particular model are used to
# encode the kind of commands that a RemoteResource can
# send to another RemoteResource, using the Controls
# controller and the Control ActiveResource, which
# are used by all CBRAIN Rails applications.

    # -------- GENERIC COMMAND PARAMETERS --------

    # An ID, usually assigned by the receiver.
    :id,

    # Command keyword, one of 'clean_cache', 'stop_workers', 'start_workers',
    # etc. On the receiving end, the method "process_command_#{:command}"
    # will be executed with the current command object.
    :command,

    # Will be set by receiver to "OK" or "FAILED", so that when
    # the command object is returned the sender will know.
    :command_execution_status,

    # Auth token of originator (for security)
    :sender_token,

    # Auth token of the current remote resource (for security)
    :receiver_token,

    # -------- ALTER TASKS PARAMETERS --------

    # Tasks affected, as a string of comma-separated task IDs.
    # Used by the command 'alter_tasks' and 'get_task_outputs'.
    :task_ids,

    # A new task status for the tasks affected by 'alter_tasks'
    # Most be one of 'Suspended', "On Hold', 'Queued', 'Recover', etc.
    # Only some statuses are valid on these only when the tasks
    # are already in some other states. See process_command_alter_tasks().
    :new_task_status,
    :new_bourreau_id,  # for when new_task_status is 'Duplicate'

    # -------- GET TASK OUTPUTS PARAMETERS --------
    # Uses :task_ids with a single ID expected in it
    :run_number,      # supplied by queryier
    :cluster_stdout,  # filled by receiver
    :cluster_stderr,  # filled by receiver
    :script_text,     # filled by receiver

    # -------- CLEAN CACHE PARAMETERS --------

    # Which users are 'involved' in the command; only used for clean_cache
    # right now. Numeric ids as string. "3,4,5" or "all".
    :user_ids,

    # Not really used right now

    # Date of effect; for clean_cache it means cleans files older than this..

    # ... but younger than this are erased.
    :after_date,   # Time object
