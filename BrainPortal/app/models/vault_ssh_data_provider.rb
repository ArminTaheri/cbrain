# This class provides an implementation for a data provider
# where the remote files are accessed through +ssh+ and +rsync+.
# The provider's files are stored in a flat directory, two levels
# deep, directly specified by the object's +remote_dir+
# attribute and the user's login name. The file "hello"
# of user "myuser" is thus stored into a path like this:
#
#     /remote_dir/myuser/hello
#
# For the list of API methods, see the DataProvider superclass.
