# A Bourreau associated to a virtual disk image.  Tasks submitted to a
# Disk Image Bourreau are not associated to any "concrete" Bourreau until one decides to
# execute them. 
class DiskImageBourreau < Bourreau
  # Disk Image Bourreaux needs at least :cbrain_tasks,
  # :tool_configs and :tools from class Bourreau. It also needs :user
  # and :group from RemoteResource.  Inheriting class Bourreau is not
  # really correct, since the methods used for remote controlling don't
  # make sense here. This should be discussed with Pierre.  By the way,
  # inheritance of RemoteResource for BrainPortal is a bit weird too:
  # for instance, RemoteResource has :cms_class, which doesn't really
  # make sense for BrainPortal (same for :workers_instances and all
  # other symbols specific to bourreau). Following this, I put symbols
  # specific to DiskImage in RemoteResources too...

  # Raises an exception. It doesn't make sense to "start" a Disk Image Bourreau.
