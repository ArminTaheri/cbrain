#Abstract model representing a job running on a cluster. This is the core class for
#launching GridEngine/PBS/MOAB/UNIX jobs (etc) using Scir.
#
#See the document CbrainTask.txt for a complete introduction.
#
#=Attributes:
#[<b>user_id</b>] The id of the user who requested this task.
#[<b>bourreau_id</b>] The id of the Bourreau on which the task is running.
#[<b>status</b>] The status of the current task.
#[<b>params</b>] A hash of the parameters sent in the job request from BrainPortal.
#[<b>cluster_jobid</b>] The job id of the running task. This id is a string
#                       specific to the cluster management system configured for the
#                       bourreau, and has no meaning outside of there.
#[<b>cluster_workdir</b>] The work directory in which the task is running. Like the
#                         *cluster_jobid*, this directory has no meaning outside
#                         of the context of the host where the Bourreau is running.
#[<b>share_wd_tid</b>] The task id of another task; if set, the current task will
#                      be configured to execute in the same +cluster_workdir+.
#[<b>prerequisites</b>] A hash table providing information about what other
#                       tasks the current task depend on.
#[<b>log</b>] A log of task's progress.
#
#<b>ClusterTask objects should not be instantiated directly.</b> Instead, subclasses of ClusterTask should be created to
#represent requests for specific processing tasks.
#
#= Creating a ClusterTask subclass
#Subclasses of ClusterTask will have to override the following methods to function properly:
#[<b>setup</b>] Perform any preparatory steps before launching the job (e.g. syncing files).
#[*cluster_commands*] Returns an array of the bash commands to be run by the job.
#[*save_results*] Perform any finalization steps after the job is run (e.g. saving result files).
#
#Note that all these methods can access request parameters through the hash in the +params+
#attribute.
#
#A generator script has been written to simplify the creation of ClusterTask subclasses. To
#use it, simply go to the Bourreau application's base directory and run:
#  script/generate cluster_task <your_task_name>
#This will create a template for your task.
#
#Instructions in the files themselves will indicate how to integrate your task into the system.
