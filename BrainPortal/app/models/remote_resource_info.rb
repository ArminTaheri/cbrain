# Remote Resource Info class; NOT AN ACTIVE RECORD!
#
# Original author: Pierre Rioux
#
# $Id$
#

# This model encapsulates a record with a precise list
# of attributes. This is not an ActiveRecord, it's a
# subclass of Hash. See RestrictedHash for more info.
# Note that the attributes are used for an ActiveResource
# request, and therefore must be filled with strings.
#
# The attributes in this particular model are used to
# report on the state of a RemoteResource, when queried
# by another RemoteResource. This is performed by
# using the Controls controller and the Control
# ActiveResource, which are used by all CBRAIN
# Rails applications.
