#   # Sample of regular route:
#   #   match 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'
#   # Keep in mind you can assign values other than :controller and :action
# 
#   # Sample of named route:
#   #   match 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', :as => :purchase
#   # This route can be invoked with purchase_url(:id => product.id)
# 
#   # Sample resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
#   #   resources :products
# 
#   # Sample resource route with options:
#   #   resources :products do
#   #     member do
#   #       get 'short'
#   #       post 'toggle'
#   #     end

#   #   resources :products do
#   #     resources :comments, :sales
#   #     resource :seller

#   # Sample resource route within a namespace:
#   #   namespace :admin do
#   #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
#   #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
#   #     resources :products

#   # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
#   # just remember to delete public/index.html.
#   # root :to => "welcome#index"
# 
#   # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes"
# 
#   # This is a legacy wild controller route that's not recommended for RESTful applications.
#   # Note: This route will make all actions in every controller accessible via GET requests.
#   # match ':controller(/:action(/:id(.:format)))'
