# Instructions:
#
# 1) Copy this file as 'config_portal.rb' in the current directory.
#
# 2) Edit your copy to suit your deployment environement.
#    DO NOT CHECK-IN your file 'config_portal.rb' !
#
# 3) Leave this template alone; when new configuration options are
#    added to CBRAIN, they will show up here as this file is under version
#    control. The file 'validation_portal.rb' will warn you and
#    you'll have to update your .rb file based on the .rb.TEMPLATE.

  # This is used by BrainPortal as the list of available clusters.
  # The defaults/prefered cluster is the first one

  # This hash maps short names of clusters to the Bourreau resource URI
  # running on the clusters' frontends

    "cluster_a"           => "http://cluster_a_url.ca/",
