  If this is correct, enter the keyword 'yes' and we will adjust all the

  convert them to UTC time. If this doesn't seem right, hit CTRL-C or
  enter "NO" now.

  If this is correct, enter the keyword 'yes' and we will adjust all the

  Error: Configuration incomplete!

  For this migration to work, you must make sure that the
  Rails application has the proper time zone configured
  in this file:

     #{RAILS_ROOT}/config/environment.rb

  Edit the file and change this line so it says:

     config.time_zone = "your time zone name"

  The full list of time zone names can be obtained by
  running the rake task:

    rake time:zones:all

  and a more particular subset of acceptable names
  for your current machine can be seen by running

    rake time:zones:local

    TZ_ERROR

    raise "Configuration Incomplete"
  end

  def self.get_offset

    offset = Time.zone.now.utc_offset

    puts <<-"INFO"

  It seems the time difference between the local time zone,

    #{Time.now.zone}

  and Universal Time is #{offset} seconds (#{offset / 3600} hours).

  These numbers should be negative if you are in the western hemisphere,
  and positive in the Eastern one.
