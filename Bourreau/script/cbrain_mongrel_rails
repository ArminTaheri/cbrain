# CBRAIN patch that makes the server write the word 'STOPPED'
# to a status file when the server exits (whether it's properly
# or as a result of a failure to start).
#
# The path to the status file is provided by an environment
# variable, and usually this is setup by the cbrain_remote_ctl
# script.
