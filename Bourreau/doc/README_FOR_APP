== About BrainPortal

Bourreau is the backend side of the CBRAIN architecture. It is a
Rails application that provides access to a processing cluster.

== The main Ruby classes that are of interest are:

DrmaaTask:: this models a task request to a cluster, and its evolving states. They are ActiveRecord objects.
Scir:: this module encapsulate an API to the cluster; particular implementations for SGE, PBS and UNIX can be found in Scir::ScirSgeSession, Scir::ScirPbsSession and Scir::ScirLocalSession
