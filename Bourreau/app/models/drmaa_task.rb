#Abstract model representing a job running on a cluster. This is the core class for
#launching GridEngine/PBS jobs using Scir.
#
#=Attributes:
#[<b>user_id</b>] The id of the user who requested this task.
#[<b>bourreau_id</b>] The id of the Bourreau on which the task is running.
#[<b>status</b>] The status of the current task.
#[<b>params</b>] A hash of the parameters sent in the job request from BrainPortal.
#[<b>drmaa_jobid</b>] The job id of the running task. This id is a string
#                     specific to the cluster management system configured for the
#                     bourreau, and has no meaning outside of there.
#[<b>drmaa_workdir</b>] The work directory in which the task is running. Like the
#                       *drmaa_jobid*, this directory has no meaning outside
#                       of the context of the host where the Bourreau is running.
#[<b>share_wd_tid</b>] The task id of another task; if set, the current task will
#                      be configured to execute in the same +drmaa_workdir+.
#[<b>prerequisites</b>] A hash table providing information about what other
#                       tasks the current task depend on.
#[<b>log</b>] A log of task's progress.
#
#<b>DrmaaTask should not be instantiated directly.</b> Instead, subclasses of DrmaaTask should be created to
#represent requests for specific processing tasks.
#Unlike the DrmaaTask model on the portal side, these here are *ActiveRecord* models, meaning
#they do represent rows in the database directly.
#
#= Creating a DrmaaTask subclass
#Subclasses of DrmaaTask will have to override the following methods to function properly:
#[<b>setup</b>] Perform any preparatory steps before launching the job (e.g. syncing files).
#[*drmaa_commands*] Returns an array of the bash commands to be run by the job.
#[*save_results*] Perform any finalization steps after the job is run (e.g. saving result files).
#
#Note that all these methods can access request parameters through the hash in the +params+
#attribute.
#
#A generator script has been written to simplify the creation of DrmaaTask subclasses. To
#use it, simply go to the Bourreau application's base directory and run:
#  script/generate cluster_task <your_task_name>
#This will create a template for your task.
#
#Instructions in the files themselves will indicate how to integrate your task into the system.

  # The attribute 'params' is a serialized hash table
  # containing job-specific parameters; it's up to each
  # subclass of DrmaaTask to find/use/define its content
  # as necessary.
  serialize :params

  # The attribute 'prerequisites' is a serialized hash table
  # containing the information about whether the current
  # task depend on the states of other tasks. As an example,
  # if the hash is this:
  #
  #     {
  #        :for_setup           => { "T12" => "Queued", "T13" => "Completed" },
  #        :for_post_processing => { "T66" => "Failed" },
  #     }
  #
  # then the task will be setup by a Worker only when task #12 and #13 are
  # in the indicated states or further, and the task will enter post_process() only
  # when task #66 has failed. The only allowed keys right now are
  # :for_setup and :for_post_processing, as these are the only two
  # states triggered by Workers.
  #
  # The task's ID are serialized with strings with a prefix consisting
  # of the single character 'T'. This is needed so that the structure
  # is properly serialized in XML during ActiveResource transport.
  #
  # The only allowed state values for the conditions are:
  #
  #  - 'Queued' (which also covers ALL subsequent states up to 'Completed')
  #  - 'Data Ready' (which also covers 'Completed')
  #  - 'Completed'
  #  - 'Failed' (which covers all failures)
  #
  # As an aide, note that in a way, a value 'n' in the DrmaaTask attribute
  # :share_wd_tid also implies this prerequisite:
  #
  #     :for_setup => { "T#{n}" => "Queued" }
  #
  # unless a more restrictive prerequisite is already supplied for task 'n'.
