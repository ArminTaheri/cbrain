# GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:
#
# There are three methods that needs to be completed,
# setup(), drmaa_commands() and save_results(). These
# methods have the following properties:
#
#   a) They will all be invoked while ruby's current
#      directory has already been changed to a work
#      directory that is 'grid-aware' (usually, a
#      subdirectory shared by the nodes)
#
#   b) They all receive in their 'params' attribute
#      a hash table containing the key-value pairs
#      constructed on the BrainPortal side
#
#   c) Except for drmaa_commands(), they should all
#      return true when everything is OK. A false
#      return value in setup() or save_results() will
#      cause the object to be stuck to the state
#      "Failed To Setup" or "Failed To Postprocess",
#      respectively.
#
#   d) The method drmaa_commands() returns an array
#      of shell commands.
#
#   e) The method setup() MUST call once the
#      method pre_synchronize_userfile(userfile)
#      on any userfile that it will need to access;
#      this will have the effect of scheduling
#      a rsync command to synchronize the userfile's
#      content on the BrainPortal's host with the local
#      cache. IMPORTANT: the rsync command is run
#      JUST BEFORE the commands returned by
#      drmaa_commands() are executed as a cluster job,
#      not when pre_synchronize_userfile() is called!
#      This means that the .name() and .vaultname()
#      methods of Userfile could return path to
#      files that do not yet exist locally!
#
#   f) The method save_results() MUST call once the
#      method post_synchronize_userfile(userfile)
#      on any userfile it creates or updates. This
#      will schedule a rsync command to synchronized
#      the userfile's content back to the BrainPortal's
#      host.

# Class declaration: You need to replace the word TEMPLATE
# by a name for the type of processing you try to accomplish.
# E.g. DrmaaCivet or DrmaaMinc2jiv ; casing is important, it
# must work with the camelize() and uncamelize() Rails
# functions. Also, the name of the file must be adjusted
# accordingly.
